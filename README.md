## What is ButlerDelivery?

.....

## Roadmap
......

## Prequisites

* Homebrew v1.7.6
* (for Android) an up-to-date Android Studio
* (for Android) Genemotion and an Android device
* (for iOS) an up-to-date copy of Xcode (is xcode mac only???)
* (for iOS) an iOS simulator and an iOS device


## The Stack

* React Native CLI 1.2.0
* React Native v0.55.4 (there might be a problem for react-native version higher than 0.56.0 so we need to downgrade the version manually)
* Node.js v10.11.0
* Watchman v4.9.1

## Setup

### Requirements

Since we do not have a provisioned development environment, you'll need to install the following tools manually on your OS. You should be able to work on any OS, but so far only Windows and OSX have been tested.

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Any newer version should work, but I am working on `10.8.0`. I highly recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install NodeJS as it allows you to easily work with multiple versions of NodeJS on the same machine. 
* [Yarn](yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). We'll be using `yarn` instead of `npm` to manage our depedencies.

That's it! Everything else is installed via `yarn`.
